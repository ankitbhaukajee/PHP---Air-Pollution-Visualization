The dangerous effect of Air Pollution on a human body commonly leads to lung cancer which is one of the major health concern today.  Enormous evidences are available to prove that the outdoor air that people breathe can be in all possibility be a mixture of the vehicle exhaust, industrial gas burn, which can be the cause of lung cancer. One of the most important factor in this regard is the particle pollution. Particle Pollution is the mixing of very small or tiny solid and liquid particles that are present in the air. These can be made up of numerous components like acids, soil and dust particles. The emission of these can occur from Wood Stoves, Forest Fires, Vehicles and other sources.

When we breathe, the bigger air particles get into our body but due to their bigger size they get out when we cough or sneeze them out. That is why the smaller particles are more dangerous, because of their size they get stuck inside the human lungs. Causing damage to the lungs and leading to lung cancer. Unlike many other industrialized nations, the air pollution levels in the United States have been decreasing gradually at a steady pace.  But there is a word of caution from the experts.
